osgRecipes
=============

The osgRecipes project includes different recipes written with OpenSceneGraph (OSG) and can help developers work
with this famous 3D rendering engine, as well as other auxiliary libraries. The osgRecipes project itself is in
the Public Domain, but some of its recipes may be under other licenses.

This project is also the source code repository of Rui Wang & Xuelei Qian's book `OpenSceneGraph 3.0 Cookbook`,
Packt Publishing, 2012. You may read more details or order this book at:
http://www.packtpub.com/openscenegrap-3-for-advanced-3d-programming-using-api-cookbook/book

------------
Installation
------------

1. Use CMake (or cmake-gui) to build makefiles or solutions of the recipes
# cmake <recipe_dir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir>

2. Run 'make' to build and install all recipes
# make
# make install

4. Copy all files in the data directory to 'bin' in the installed directory
# cp <recipe_dir>/cookbook/data/*.* <install_dir>/bin

5. Have fun!

You may have to download and compile these third-party dependencies to test all the recipes:
* CEGUI: http://www.cegui.org.uk
* NVIDIA Cg: http://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit
* DirectInput (Windows only): http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/aa937788
* GLUT: http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut
* NVIDIA Physx (version 2.8.x): http://developer.nvidia.com/physx-downloads
* Qt (version 4): http://qt.nokia.com/products
* FireBreath: http://www.firebreath.org/display/documentation/FireBreath+Home

Integrations
------------

This section will show you how to integrate OSG with different kinds of libraries and SDKs. These libraries can
add extra functionalities like special effects, visual components and interaction methods to your OSG scene and
greatly improve the performance of the applications. These libraries must be free for downloading and for
non-commercial purpose of use. The license of the example code may vary according to the license of the third-
party library if it does not fit the public domain.

After compiling all the source code, you have to copy the data directory to 'bin' in the installed directory
# cp -r <recipe_dir>/integrations/data <install_dir>/bin

The third-party libraries that can be embedded with OSG are listed here for downloading:
* AntTweakBar (a light and intuitive GUI framework): http://www.antisphere.com/Wiki/tools:anttweakbar
* AssImp (a library to import various well-known 3D model formats): http://assimp.sourceforge.net/
* Awesomium (a web-browser framework for in-app browsing and HTML UIs): http://awesomium.com/
* FreeImage (a library supporting popular image formats): http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/
* libGizmo (gizmo control library for 3D object manipulation): https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/LibGizmo
* Microsoft Kinect SDK: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/developer-downloads.aspx
* MyGUI (a fast, flexible and simple GUI): http://mygui.info/
* NVIDIA PhysX (a well-rounded physics engine, version 3.2): http://developer.nvidia.com/physx-downloads
* RVO2 (Reciprocal collision avoidance for multi-agent simulation): http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO2/
* Spark (a crossplatform particle engine): http://spark.developpez.com/
* TUIO (a common API for tangible multitouch surfaces): already included in the source code
* VLC (a cross-platform multimedia player and framework): http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
